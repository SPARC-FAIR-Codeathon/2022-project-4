# Leaflet Interactions with Flatmaps
Using Leaflet to interact with flatmaps in a Jupyter notebook. Taking Sparcs mapping to a farther platform.

## Project Goals

This application allows flatmaps to be viewed in (Jupyter Notebook)[https://jupyter.org/] and be used in new and different ways using (leaflet software)[https://leafletjs.com/index.html] to futher understand the information shown in the flatmaps. The functions we created are:
1. Viewing two maps side by side in a split map. there are different approaches:
   -a chosen SPARC flatmap compared to another chosen SPARC flatmap
   -a chosen image or flatmap from an outside source compared with a SPARC flatmap
2.
